dim:
- extract the integration tree logic and make it generally useful, maybe for a
  drm-integration tree ...
- add option to check-patch to check stdin
- integrate ninja-check? Or too much checkers considered harmful?

- add patchwork Link: also after manually resolving conflicts in drm
  apply-resolved
- pull in dim extract-tags tool from Ville
- allow dim rebuild-nightly to pull branches from local trees in dry-run mode.
  This is useful to confirm a backmerge is indeed correct, by comparing the
  resulting -nightly with the old one. Current the branch must be pushed out
  first for rebuild-nightly to pick it up, which means the merge can't be
  fixed any more.

qf:
- get better at preventing and cleaning up a mess when switching branches
  while there's still applied quilt patches around ...
- combine quilt annotate and git blame into one tool
- use the index a bit more to e.g. stage all applied quilt patches, then use
  the output of git diff to refresh a quilt patch
- use git commit-tree and git write-tree in the setup code instead of the
  current high-level hacks
- track/restore the topmost patch maybe?
- synchronize quilt notes in qf push and qf fetch
