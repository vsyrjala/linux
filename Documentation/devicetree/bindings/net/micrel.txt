Micrel PHY properties.

These properties cover the base properties Micrel PHYs.

Optional properties:

 - micrel,led-mode : LED mode value to set for PHYs with configurable LEDs.

	Configure the LED mode with single value. The list of PHYs and the
	bits that are currently supported:

	KSZ8001: register 0x1e, bits 15..14
	KSZ8041: register 0x1e, bits 15..14
	KSZ8021: register 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8031: register 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8051: register 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8081: register 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8091: register 0x1f, bits 5..4

	See the respective PHY datasheet for the mode values.

 - micrel,rmii-reference-clock-select-25-mhz: RMII Reference Clock Select
						bit selects 25 MHz mode

	Setting the RMII Reference Clock Select bit enables 25 MHz rather
	than 50 MHz clock mode.

	Note that this option in only needed for certain PHY revisions with a
	non-standard, inverted function of this configuration bit.
	Specifically, a clock reference ("rmii-ref" below) is always needed to
	actually select a mode.

 - clocks, clock-names: contains clocks according to the common clock bindings.

	supported clocks:
	- KSZ8021, KSZ8031, KSZ8081, KSZ8091: "rmii-ref": The RMII reference
	  input clock. Used to determine the XI input clock.

 - micrel,fiber-mode: If present the PHY is configured to operate in fiber mode

	Some PHYs, such as the KSZ8041FTL variant, support fiber mode, enabled
	by the FXEN boot strapping pin. It can't be determined from the PHY
	registers whether the PHY is in fiber mode, so this boolean device tree
	property can be used to describe it.

	In fiber mode, auto-negotiation is disabled and the PHY can only work in
	100base-fx (full and half duplex) modes.

 - lan8814,ignore-ts: If present the PHY will not support timestamping.

	This option acts as check whether Timestamping is supported by
	hardware or not. LAN8814 phy support hardware tmestamping.

 - lan8814,latency_rx_10: Configures Latency value of phy in ingress at 10 Mbps.

 - lan8814,latency_tx_10: Configures Latency value of phy in egress at 10 Mbps.

 - lan8814,latency_rx_100: Configures Latency value of phy in ingress at 100 Mbps.

 - lan8814,latency_tx_100: Configures Latency value of phy in egress at 100 Mbps.

 - lan8814,latency_rx_1000: Configures Latency value of phy in ingress at 1000 Mbps.

 - lan8814,latency_tx_1000: Configures Latency value of phy in egress at 1000 Mbps.
